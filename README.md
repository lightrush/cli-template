# Command-line interface (CLI) template

This is a quick template for creating command-line interface apps using Python and Click.


# Why

Eliminate the need to look up the same introductory documentation over and over, every time we need to create a CLI tool. Instead, fork and/or clone this template and start adding the needed functions.


# Getting started

```
git clone [url here]
pipenv install
./cli.py
```
